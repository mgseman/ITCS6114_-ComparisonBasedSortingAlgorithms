This folder contains a visual studio solution of the project used to complete Project 1 for the course ITCS6114 at
UNCC. This folder contains all of the source code used including the required files for pbPlots.

The project requires no linkers and can be compiled using any ide with the header and source files in this folder.

In the debug folder is a .exe that runs the compiled program used to create the plots.

When running the source.cpp file which contains main() the three .png files will be created which show the graphs
from each analysis. The raw times for each sorting algorithm is shown in the windows command prompt after compiling the
program.
